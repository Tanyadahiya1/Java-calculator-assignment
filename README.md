# 🧮 Calculator Application using Method Overloading ---

### 🧠 **Project Objective**
To design and implement a **Calculator Application** that demonstrates the concept of **Method Overloading** in Java.  
The calculator allows users to perform **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** with various data types.

---

### ⚙️ **Features**
- Demonstrates **method overloading** (`add()` method with multiple versions)
- Supports **integer** and **double** arithmetic
- **Menu-driven interface** using Java control structures
- Handles **divide-by-zero** gracefully with exception handling
- Simple and beginner-friendly structure (ideal for BCA/B.Tech 3rd semester)

---

### 🧩 **Concepts Used**
- Method Overloading  
- Polymorphism  
- Exception Handling  
- Control Structures (switch-case, loops)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (class and object)  
- Input/Output using `Scanner`
